# Task Management RBAC Demo (React, Node, Express)

Welcome to the **Task Management RBAC Demo**! This project demonstrates the implementation of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in a simple task management application. The application is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the backend.

---

## Project Overview

In this demo, we showcase how RBAC can be implemented in the simplest way to control access to certain resources in a task management app. There are different user roles with various levels of permissions:

- **Admin**: Has access to **all** tasks and can **create, read, update,** and **delete** any task.
- **Moderator**: Has access to **all** tasks but can only **read** and **update** them. Cannot create or delete tasks for the other users.
- **User**: Can only manage **their own tasks**. The permissions include creating, reading, updating, and deleting their own tasks.

---

## User Roles & Permissions

The app uses the following **roles** and **permissions**:

### Permissions

- **task:create_own**: Create a task for yourself.
- **task:read_own**: Read your own tasks.
- **task:update_own**: Update your own tasks.
- **task:delete_own**: Delete your own tasks.

### Roles

1. **Admin**:

   - Permissions: All task permissions (`task:create_any`, `task:read_any`, `task:update_any`, `task:delete_any`) + user permissions for their own tasks (`task:create_own`, `task:read_own`, `task:update_own`, `task:delete_own`).

2. **Moderator**:

   - Permissions: Can manage any task's visibility (`task:read_any`, `task:update_any`) but only their own tasks can be created, updated, or deleted.

3. **User**:
   - Permissions: Can only manage their own tasks (`task:create_own`, `task:read_own`, `task:update_own`, `task:delete_own`).

### User Example Data

| **Username**        | **Password** | **Role**  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| aditya@gmail.com    | 123456       | user1     |
| testuser3@gmail.com | hello$123    | user2     |
| testuser4@gmail.com | hello$123    | moderator |
| testuser5@gmail.com | hello$123    | admin     |

### Tasks Example

| **Task ID** | **Task Title**      | **Task Description**                      | **Assigned User (ID)** |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1           | Fix server issues   | Resolve downtime issues on the backend    | admin (User ID: 1)     |
| 2           | Review user reports | Moderate flagged comments                 | moderator (User ID: 2) |
| 3           | Submit project      | Upload the final version of the app       | user1 (User ID: 3)     |
| 4           | Update profile      | Change profile picture and details        | user2 (User ID: 4)     |
| 5           | Deploy frontend     | Deploy the latest build of the React app  | admin (User ID: 1)     |
| 6           | Write blog post     | Draft and publish a blog post on the site | user1 (User ID: 3)     |
| 7           | Resolve tickets     | Respond to customer support tickets       | moderator (User ID: 2) |

## Running the Project

### 1. Backend Setup (Node + Express)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the **backend** directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the **backend** root directory with the following structure:

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   DB_URI=your_database_url
   PORT=8000
   ```

5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

1. Navigate to the **frontend** directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the **frontend** root directory with the following structure:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

4. Run the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the frontend app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Application Flow

### 1. **Login Form**

Users start by logging into the application. The login form allows them to enter their credentials to authenticate.

![Login Form](./image1_Login_form.png)

### 2. **Registration Form**

New users can register by filling out the registration form. A user can specify their username, password, and role during registration.

![Registration Form](./image2_register_form.png)

### 3. **Registration with Roles**

A new user registers and is assigned a role (Admin, Moderator, or User). This determines their access level in the system.

![Registration with Roles](./image3_register_form_with_roles.png)

### 4. **Dashboard After Login**

After successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard displays the tasks assigned to the user based on their role and permissions.

![Dashboard](./image4_dashboard_after_login.png)

### 5. **Adding a New Task**

Admins and users with the required permissions can add new tasks. The form allows users to fill in the task title and description.

![Adding New Task](./image5_adding_new_task.png)

### 6. **Editing a Task**

Once tasks are created, users can edit them by clicking the "three dots" (more options) next to each task.

![Editing Task](./image6_editing_new_task_after_the_three_dots_more_icon.png)

### 7. **Logout and View User Roles**

Users can log out from the system, and admins can view user roles to manage access permissions.

![Logout and View User Roles](./image7_Logout_and_view_user_roles.png)

### 8. **Deleting a Task**

Users with delete permissions can delete tasks. A confirmation prompt appears before deletion to ensure the action is intentional.

## API Endpoints

- Body: `{ "username": "user@example.com", "password": "password123", "role": "user" }`
- Response: `201 Created` or `400 Bad Request` if validation fails or user already exists.

### 2. **POST /api/login** - Login a user and get JWT token

- Body: `{ "username": "user@example.com", "password": "password123" }`
- Response: `200 OK` with the JWT token.

### 3. **GET /api/tasks** - Get all tasks (RBAC-based visibility)

- Only accessible by users with `task:read_any` or `task:read_own` permissions.

### 4. **POST /api/tasks** - Create a new task

## Conclusion

This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of how to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in a modern web application using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend. The application uses JWT authentication, form validation, and access control based on user roles. It can easily be extended or integrated into more complex applications.
